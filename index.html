	<!-- About the Store -->
     <p>
        Mohammed Groceries is a well-established convenience store located at 33 Amatola Road, Finsbury, Randfontein.
		Owned and operated by Mr. Mohammed Dulabai, the store has become a cornerstone of the local community. 
		With over 10 years of trusted service, it is known not just for its wide range of everyday essentials, but also for its warm and reliable customer care.
		The store is moderately sized with two neat aisles, making it easy for customers to find what they need without feeling overwhelmed.
		The setup is simple and welcoming, offering a shopping experience that is quick, convenient, and personal.
		People of all ages and backgrounds shop here regularly, and it‚Äôs not unusual to find loyal customers chatting with Mr. Mohammed as they shop.
		His approachable nature and community-oriented mindset have made the store a familiar and comforting presence in the neighborhood.

    <!-- Products and Services -->
     <p>
        Mohammed Groceries stocks a variety of essential products catering to the daily needs of families and individuals. 
		Customers can find fresh vegetables, basic cooking ingredients like sugar, flour, and milk, as well as snacks, candy, and cold beverages. 
		The store also supplies household and personal care items such as toiletries, candles, and cleaning supplies.
		What makes the store stand out is that it occasionally offers small home essentials like plastic chairs, mini storage items, or kitchen utensils,making it more than just a grocery store.
		In times of urgency or late evening runs, residents of Finsbury often rely on Mohammed Groceries for quick access to essentials.
		It serves as a practical and reliable solution for anyone needing last minute items or those who prefer not to travel far for basic needs.
		Over time, the store has come to understand the preferences of the community and often adjusts its stock accordingly.

    <!-- Reason for Creating Website -->
     <p>
        The reason I chose to design a website for Mohammed Groceries is because it is more than just a local store,it is a part of our community‚Äôs identity. 
		My family and I have known Mr. Mohammed for many years, and we‚Äôve grown to admire not only his strong work ethic but also his generosity and understanding. 
		For example, if someone is short by a few rands, he often allows them to take the item and return later with the rest of the money which is something that reflects his deep care for his customers.
		The store has never had a digital presence, and I believe creating a website would help it grow by attracting more customers, especially younger people who prefer looking up products or store hours online.
		This project also gives me a chance to apply my skills meaningfully and give back to a business that has served me and my neighborhood with honesty and kindness for over a decade.
